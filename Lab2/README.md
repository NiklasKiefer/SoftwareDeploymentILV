# Lab2
The task of this lab is to build an azure devops pipeline using NodeJS. Using DevOps, this app should automatically be deployed when commited. The NodeJS app should be provided with test cases. There should be a build pipeline aswell as a release pipeline, that accepts a release in production. But there should be a manual check before release. Finally, Azure Application Insights should be implemented.
